![boolean](./equal.png)

A simple tool to determine if two boolean expressions are equal.

Library code is ported over from [`semibran/bool`][bool]. The truth table tab is left unclickable, though the aforementioned library has a command line interface for it.

## setup
Requires GNU Make 3.8.2 and above. Note that Mac comes packaged with 3.8.1 by default.
```sh
$ npm i
$ make watch
```
